\maketitle
\section{Programming Environment}
When creating this program, I ran it in the terminal for El Capitan. I downloaded the GNU C Compiler and then decided that the text editor I would use would be Sublime Text 2.

\section{Does this program work for all potential inputs?}

\section{Modularity}
I believe that my use of modularity deserve a lot of points. I didn't just have one function that did everything, but I broke it up into several functions that all could be used again for different purposes.

\section{Who did you ask for help?}
I didn't really ask for too much help. I did ask for help from Professor Merlo, however I do believe I miswrote my email address when signing up for his website, because my emails never came through. Other than that, I used the getLine() function from the C Programming textbook.

\section{Debugging}
My biggest problem would have to be adding the period to the sentence. When I first started to debug my program, I had the function search for a doubleSpace and then it would move every character starting with the first double space over one and add a period to where the first space was. It's just never worked.

While it wasn't my go to move to do this, I did eventually burn the entire doubleSpace method down and start anew. I decided to create the copy of my string and then where the first space of the string is, it is replaced with a period and then replaced the next character over the second space with a space. Then after that space, I add every single character from that point forward from the copy of the string into the original string. That was more effective.
