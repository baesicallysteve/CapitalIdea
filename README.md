# Capital Idea

Author: Steven Turner
Latest Version: Version 1.0.0 
Language: C 
Description:
The purpose of this program is to take standard input and convert it so that the output will take a double space, insert a period and then capitalize the next letter

Sample Input:
hey how are you  i was thinking about getting some lunch  how about 5  

Sample Output:
Hey how are you.  I was thinking about getting some lunch.  How about 5.


Current Bugs:
As of right now, the program will properly put a period for the first sentence and double space, however after the first two sentences, it capitalizes the second letter of the word and not the first one.
